The codes is to perform the simulation of coupling ATMD system for seismic response control of two adjacent buildings.

The codes are based on the paper as follows:

Kwan-Soon Park and Seung-Yong Ok, "Coupling ATMD system for seismic response control of two adjacent buildings, submitted to Shock and Vibration.

All programs can be performed based on the MATLAB progam by incorporating MATLAB Control System Toolbox. 

The useful information about the codes is as follows
  - Main optimization program is : "genATd42BD01.m". 
  - Design example model : model.m
  - Genetic code : GeneB1artmdB2.m
  - Fitness evaluation : fitFnB1atmdB2.m

Remark:
- One could modify the files to solve other similar problems of interest.
